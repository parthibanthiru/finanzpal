      <section id="what-is-etf-plan">
        <h2>1. What is an ETF savings plan?</h2>
        <p>
          An ETF savings plan is an automatic investment where your broker invests a fixed amount of money into one or more
          exchange‑traded funds (ETFs) on a regular schedule, for example every month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of trying to time the market, you invest continuously. Over many years this can smooth out short‑term price swings
          and help you build long‑term wealth with relatively little effort.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>2. How does it work in practice?</h2>
        <p>
          In Germany most online brokers offer ETF savings plans. You choose the ETF, the amount, and the execution date
          (for example the 1st or 15th of each month).
        </p>
        <p>
          On that date the broker uses money from your cash account or bank account to buy ETF shares for you. If the price is high
          you get fewer units, if the price is low you get more. Over time you build up a position automatically.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="costs">
        <h2>3. Costs you should know</h2>
        <p>
          With an ETF savings plan there are typically two types of cost: the internal ETF cost (the ongoing charge known as TER)
          and the transaction cost charged by your broker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many brokers in Germany offer selected ETF savings plans with very low or even zero order fees, especially for monthly amounts.
          However, the underlying ETF still has running costs, so it is worth comparing similar ETFs and avoiding unnecessarily expensive products.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="how-to-choose-etf">
        <h2>4. How to choose an ETF</h2>
        <p>
          For most long‑term investors, broad and simple is usually better than complex and exotic. Many people choose a global stock ETF
          that tracks a large, diversified index, sometimes with thousands of companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          When comparing ETFs, look at: index coverage, ongoing costs (TER), fund size, and how long the ETF has existed.
          Make sure you understand whether the ETF accumulates or distributes dividends, because this can affect your tax situation and cash flow.
        </p>

      <section id="steps-to-set-up">
        <h2>5. Step‑by‑step: set up your plan</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open a securities account (depot) with a broker that offers ETF savings plans for residents in Germany.</li>
          <li>Transfer money to your cash account or link your bank account for direct debit.</li>
          <li>Search for the ETF using its name or ISIN and check the key data and costs.</li>
          <li>Click “Set up savings plan” and choose the monthly amount and execution date.</li>
          <li>Confirm the plan and check the confirmation in your broker’s app or online portal.</li>
          <li>Review the plan once or twice per year, not every week, to avoid emotional decisions.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="taxes">
        <h2>6. Taxes in Germany: what to know</h2>
        <p>
          Investment income in Germany is usually subject to a flat tax (Abgeltungsteuer) plus solidarity surcharge and, where relevant,
          church tax. The broker normally handles the tax calculation and deduction for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use your annual tax‑free allowance by submitting an exemption order (Freistellungsauftrag) to your broker.
          For more complex situations or larger portfolios it can be sensible to speak to a tax advisor.
        </p>

      <section id="checklist">
        <h2>7. Checklist before you start</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You have an emergency fund for short‑term problems and do not need the invested money in the next 5–10 years.</li>
          <li>You understand that ETF prices can fall sharply in the short term and that there are no guarantees.</li>
          <li>You have chosen a simple, broadly diversified ETF and checked the ongoing costs.</li>
          <li>You know the total amount you are comfortable investing each month without financial stress.</li>
          <li>You have a basic idea of how taxes on investment income work in Germany.</li>
        </ul>
